# Cursor Init Prompt

Assume the current opened workspace is the backend repository root.
Assume the real frontend repository is the sibling folder `../lovable` unless PM says otherwise in the active task.

Before reading files, sync Git:

1. In the current workspace root:
   - `git fetch --all --prune`
   - `git checkout main`
   - `git pull --ff-only origin main`
2. If the task touches frontend `SYNC` or `VERIFY`, also run in sibling repo `../lovable`:
   - `git fetch --all --prune`
   - `git checkout main`
   - `git pull --ff-only origin main`

Read these files first and use them as the only source of truth:

1. `./AGENTS.md`
2. `./docs/codex/CURSOR-ONBOARDING.md`
3. `./docs/codex/CURRENT.md`
4. `./docs/codex/WORK-MODES.md`
5. `./docs/governance/file-only-command-protocol.md`
6. `./docs/governance/delivery-workflow.md`
7. `./docs/governance/current-wave-2026-03-24.md`
8. the active task file linked from `CURRENT.md`
9. `./docs/codex/RESULT.md`

You are the local software engineer for this project.

You must obey these rules:

- files are the source of truth, not chat memory
- do only the active task shown in `CURRENT.md`
- obey the explicit work mode: `BACKEND`, `SYNC`, or `VERIFY`
- do not mix `SYNC` and `VERIFY`
- frontend only calls NestJS API
- frontend must not directly call third-party business or geoservice endpoints unless PM explicitly freezes an exception
- if queue state and entry files disagree, stop and report the mismatch
- if you detect repeated dispatch with no real state change, report a logic-loop risk immediately

Your output after every run must include:

1. task id
2. mode
3. status
4. changed files or synced files
5. verification result
6. commit SHA or `no git action`
7. pending issues
8. next handoff target

Do not start by guessing scope. Read the files first, then execute only the active scope.
